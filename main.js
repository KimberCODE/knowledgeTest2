/**
 * Time to test our Knowledge!
 * This test is designed to challenge your understanding of various JavaScript concepts,
 *  including the Document Object Model (DOM), loops, arrays, objects, and more. It's a
 * fantastic opportunity to showcase your skills and see how far you've come in your
 * JavaScript learning adventure. Remember, this test isn't just about getting the right
 * answersâ€”it's about applying what you've learned and thinking critically about each
 * question.
 *
 * Here's how to navigate through the test:
 *
 * Multiple Choice Questions:
 * For questions with multiple-choice answers, please place an asterisk (*) before the
 * letter of the option you believe is correct. For example, if you think the answer to
 * question 1 is A, you should format your answer like this:
 *
 *     *A) Document Object Model
 *
 * True or False:
 * For true or false questions, follow the same format by placing an asterisk (*) before
 * your chosen answer. Here's how you should do it:
 *
 *     *True
 *
 * Fill in the Blanks:
 * For fill-in-the-blank questions, please write your answer within a JavaScript comment
 * For instance:
 *
 *     // className
 *
 * Short Answer:
 * Similar to the fill-in-the-blank section, please provide your answers within
 * JavaScript comments. For example:
 *
 *     // function getObjectName(object) { return object.name; }
 *
 * Function Creation Problems:
 * For the Function Creation problems, you can write your JavaScript functions directly
 * in the provided file. Make sure your functions are named correctly according to the
 * problem statement and test them to ensure they work as expected.
 *
 * Remember: There's no rush, take your time to think through the problems, and apply
 * your knowledge creatively. Good luck, and let's have some fun with JavaScript!

/**

1.) The .innerHTML property can be used to add HTML content to an element.

  *  True
    False

2.) Loops in JavaScript can only iterate forward through an array.

    True
   * False

3.) The document.querySelector() method can select elements based on both class and id selectors.

  *  True
    False

4.) In JavaScript, the spread operator is used to mutate the original array.

    True

*/

/**
 * Fill in the Blanks

1.) To remove a class from an element, you should use the __remove()__ method.

2.) When creating a loop, the syntax includes three main parts: initialization, condition, and _____iteration______.

3.) To select all elements with a specific class, the method document.____querySelectorAll______('.className') is used.

4.) Creating a copy of an array without mutating the original one can be done using the ____spread____ operator.

5.) A function that is a property of an object is called a ___function method ?_____.
 
*/

/**
 * Short Answer

1.) Explain the difference between .className and .classList when working with elements in the DOM. 
--Using "classList", you can add or remove a class without affecting any others the element may have. But if you assign "className", it will wipe out any existing classes

2.) Describe how to use a for loop to iterate over an array in JavaScript.
-- loops over a single block of code X number of times 
--  var, the variable declared in the loop redeclares the variable outside the loop. let, the variable declared in the loop does not redeclare the variable outside the loop.

3.) What is the purpose of using the spread operator in JavaScript arrays?
-- makes a copy of an array without mutating the original array and spreads them into individual elements

4.) How can you access a property of an object using a property name that contains a space?
-- bracket notation

5.) Write a simple function in JavaScript that takes an object as an argument and returns the value of the "name" property of that object.
-- let obj = {name:"", age: }
function friends(obj) {
    return obj.name;
}
