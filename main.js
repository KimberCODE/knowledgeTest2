/**
 * Time to test our Knowledge!
 * This test is designed to challenge your understanding of various JavaScript concepts,
 *  including the Document Object Model (DOM), loops, arrays, objects, and more. It's a
 * fantastic opportunity to showcase your skills and see how far you've come in your
 * JavaScript learning adventure. Remember, this test isn't just about getting the right
 * answersâ€”it's about applying what you've learned and thinking critically about each
 * question.
 *
 * Here's how to navigate through the test:
 *
 * Multiple Choice Questions:
 * For questions with multiple-choice answers, please place an asterisk (*) before the
 * letter of the option you believe is correct. For example, if you think the answer to
 * question 1 is A, you should format your answer like this:
 *
 *     *A) Document Object Model
 *
 * True or False:
 * For true or false questions, follow the same format by placing an asterisk (*) before
 * your chosen answer. Here's how you should do it:
 *
 *     *True
 *
 * Fill in the Blanks:
 * For fill-in-the-blank questions, please write your answer within a JavaScript comment
 * For instance:
 *
 *     // className
 *
 * Short Answer:
 * Similar to the fill-in-the-blank section, please provide your answers within
 * JavaScript comments. For example:
 *
 *     // function getObjectName(object) { return object.name; }
 *
 * Function Creation Problems:
 * For the Function Creation problems, you can write your JavaScript functions directly
 * in the provided file. Make sure your functions are named correctly according to the
 * problem statement and test them to ensure they work as expected.
 *
 * Remember: There's no rush, take your time to think through the problems, and apply
 * your knowledge creatively. Good luck, and let's have some fun with JavaScript!
